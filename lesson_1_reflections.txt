在bash中添加sublime启动命令
I kept getting bash: subl: C:/Program command not found

or something like that

I found my problem ended up being I had my slashes going the incorrect way, and I found if you have spaces in your file path, you have to add a slash everytime you have a space and it will fix the problem.

I ended up typing

echo 'alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/subl.exe"' >> ~/.bashrc

then subl

and sublime text was opened.

My original file path was-

C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3

so make sure you have your slashes going the correct way, and if you have spaces in your file path, to add the necessary slash after a word.

I'm on windows 10 using sublime text 3 and git bash

Hopefully this saves someone else a lot of time.
